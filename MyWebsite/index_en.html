        <h2>Plastformer is a manufacturer of pallets, containers, as well as linear and modular products made from innovative foam plastic.</h2>
        <p>We were the first to launch the production of profiles and modular constructions from a unique material developed by our company. Our range includes linear products, pallets, containers, and custom items. The main advantage of our products is their versatility, ease of processing with standard tools, and classic methods of element connection. Our material is initially used to produce planks and beams, allowing for the creation of both simple and complex structures with enhanced physical and operational characteristics, surpassing traditional counterparts such as wood and solid plastics.</p>
